    <p> Greetings MITTHU,<br> As the 13th of February approaches, I can't help but feel a rush of excitement (and maybe a few butterflies ) knowing it's your birthday! This day marks not just another year passing, but another year of incredible memories, shared laughter, and unwavering support we've built together.</p>

<p>Thinking back on our journey, I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for having you by my side. You're the most sensitive person i have met so far(who cries on every single shit). The way you always brighten up the room, offer a shoulder to cry on, make me laugh until my sides hurt truly makes a difference in my life. </p>

<p>Whether it's an In-person meet, or simply a phone call, every moment spent with you is a treasure. You have a unique ability to fall unconcious at anytime and anywhere.
On this special day, I want to shower you with all the love and joy you deserve. May your birthday be filled with joy,happiness and ofcourse,surprises and suspences as well. Remember, you are loved, appreciated, and cherished beyond words. </p>

<p>I still remember the way you said no,it was a rude yet cute one.I know you were amazed by my Elegant Outfit,and wanted to ask for my ID,if it was not,I won't have accepted anyone else's request.I apologise for the text I sent to you,it was a. shit one,however the reason behind that text was just a filthy misunderstanding,so it was not my fault at all!</p>

<p>Here's to many more years of adventures, and creating memories that will forever hold a special place in our hearts. Happy birthday,Mitthu! </p>



<p>With all my heart and soul,I wish you a Very Happy Birthday!</p>

<h2 class="our">Regards:Arman</h2>
